;; TIPS

;; (1) Jump to the dired of the current file
;;     C-x C-j - Calls `dired-jump' function.
;;     Jump to dired buffer corresponding to current buffer.
;;     If in a file, dired the current directory and move to file's line.
;;     If in Dired already, pop up a level and goto old directory's line.
;;     In case the proper dired file line cannot be found, refresh the dired
;;     buffer and try again.

;; (2) To copy the name of the file at point, in order to make use of
;;     it elsewhere, use `dired-copy-filename-as-kill', which is bound to
;;     `w'. To make it copy the absolute path: `0 w'

;; (3) To copy the path to the folder youâ€™re looking at in dired: `M-< w'

;; (4) Enable wdired mode in dired to edit the file names by hitting C-x C-q
;;     which is bound to `dired-toggle-read-only' by default. That's a wrapper
;;     function which calls `wdired-change-to-wdired-mode' in `dired-mode'.
